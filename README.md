# expense_reclass_streamlit
This is the Streamlit app for reclassifying transactions/items in large dumps. Current limit is three fields and categories. This reclassification engine is a powerful tool to classify transactions into their actual categories. Due to the modular nature of the code and libraries used, this can be applied to pretty much any transaction-level file such as GL dumps, bank statements etc.
